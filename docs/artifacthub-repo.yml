# Artifact Hub repository metadata file
#
# This file configures how Artifact Hub indexes and displays packages from this
# Helm repository. For more information, see:
# https://artifacthub.io/docs/topics/repositories/#repository-metadata-file
#
# Note: Some settings like the verified publisher flag or the ignored packages
# won't be applied until the next time the repository is processed. The repository
# is processed when the index.yaml file changes.
#
# repositoryID: The ID of the Artifact Hub repository where the packages will be published to
# (optional, but enables verified publisher status)
repositoryID: 932dd8e5-fce2-4781-b952-c3ecce7a5405

# owners: List of owners to claim repository ownership (optional)
owners:
  - name: Kube-ZEN Contributors
    email: zen@kube-zen.io

# ignore: Packages that should not be indexed by Artifact Hub (optional)
# Currently, we want all packages indexed, so this is commented out:
# ignore:
#   - name: gc-controller
#     version: beta  # Regular expression (when omitted, all versions are ignored)
