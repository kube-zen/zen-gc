# Resource limits and requests for the controller pod
# Adjust based on:
# - Number of policies (more policies = more CPU/memory)
# - Number of resources being watched (more resources = more memory for cache)
# - Deletion rate (higher rates = more CPU)
# - Concurrent evaluations (higher concurrency = more CPU)
#
# See docs/OPERATOR_GUIDE.md for detailed resource recommendations by scale
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m      # Adjust for larger workloads (see OPERATOR_GUIDE.md)
